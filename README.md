Week 3 Test: Airport
---------------------
###Task:

Imagine you're writing software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

Your task is to create a set of classes/modules to make the given test suite pass. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your test, you'll need to use stubbing to override random weather. Finally, every plane must have a status indicating whether it's flying or has landed. You may expand on the original tests.

The tests are located at: https://gist.github.com/shadchnev/5684064  
Or the RSpec equivalent: https://gist.github.com/ecomba/2fb61ab115080599f8d8

Please create separate files for every class, module and test suite. Commit it to a repo on GitHub by 5pm.

The submission will be judged on the following criteria:
* Tests pass
* Test coverage is good
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short, etc.

**Technologies used:**
* RSpec
* Ruby
